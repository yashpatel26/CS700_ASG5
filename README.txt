Morse Code is a common code  that is usually used to encrypt messages consisting of letters and digits.Each letter and digits comprises of combination of dots and dashes.


1-Each letter is stored in a node of binary tree.The root node is at depth 0 and stores no letter.The left node at depth 1 stores letter e and the right node stores the letter t.The four nodes at depth 2 stores the letters with a certain pattern of dashes and dots.

2-Message is encoded by replacing each letter by its code symbol.Make sure you use a delimiter symbol between coded letters.

3-The coded message is decoded using Morse code tree.
